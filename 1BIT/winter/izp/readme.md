IZP Acad. year 2021/2022 Winter semester 7 credits

Algorithms and problem solving: the strategy of problem-solving, structured decomposition, concept and features of the algorithm. Basic programming construction: syntax and semantics of high programming language, variables, types, expressions, control structures, procedures and functions, parameter passing, input/output, exceptional state processing. Basic data structures: simple data types, structured data types: array, record, file, strings. Dynamic data structures, the concept of pointers. Strategy for selecting an appropriate data structure. Recursion, the concept of recursion. Global and local variables. Simple recursive functions (procedures). Modular Design and abstraction. Concepts will be illustrated by using appropriate programming language. (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 Programming languages - C).
